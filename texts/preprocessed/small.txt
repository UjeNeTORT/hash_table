could
hear
emma
s
laughter
coming
through
a
shuttered
window
overhead
mingled
with
the
deeper
voice
of
the
man
she
was
entertaining
she
was
the

of
the

tankard
forty
if
she
was
a

rosey
was
her

fifteen
and

emma
had
decreed
that
rosey

would
cost
a

had
saved
nine
silver
stags
and
a
pot
of
copper
stars
and
pennies
for
all
the
good
that
would
do
him
he
would
have
stood
a
better
chance
of
hatching
a
real
dragon
than
saving
up
enough
coin
to
make
a
golden
